      <h2> Work related About Me </h2>
      <p> Where do I begin on this about me of work related items?
        <br />
        I am a High School graduate, with some collage experience.
        I started working for the military as a civilian at Fort Leonard Wood Lake of the Ozarks Recreation Area as a dock hand.
        While working at the lake I worked towards getting experience in various roles. </p>
      <br />
      <p> After working the dock hand summer position for a few years I was able to get an internship at JMARK Business Solutions.
        I started here as an intern, and worked my way up inside of the organization.
        Currently I am a Systems Administrator Level 1 at JMARK, and have been with the organization for almost five years now.
        While I currently enjoy my job, co-workers, opportunities, and the team(s) I have worked with at JMARK, but it is time for a change. I am currently seeking a change in career paths, and life, to eventually work my way up to be a full stack web developer.
         </p>
      <p>
        I am a very passionant person when it comes to work, I always strive to learn more, and be the best me I can be.
        Learning new things is one of my passions, and being able to apply my skillset and learn more as time goes on.
           </p>
